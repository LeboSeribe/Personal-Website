                        About me, Olebogeng Seribe
                        I am an ethusiastic individual who enjoys being part of a productive team and I can work very well on my own.
                            I am able to develop creative solutions to problems and demonstrate motivation required to solve problems.
                            In 2018 I served as an Academic and student development officer for Jubilee Hall of Residence 
                            at Wits University. My roles included being a liasor between the Jubilee residents and Wits Housing Managemnet.
                            I was in charge to see to it that the programmes designed for first year students to adapt to the new diverse envirionment.
                            I also managed Jubilee Debate Team. I saw to it that the educational support structure for Jubilee Residents is functional and efficient.

                            I was a mentor to first year students from the year 2016 to 2018. I t was a fulfilling role because it allowed me to better
                                other students'  lives based on my experiences. 
                                I have been recognised by Jubilee hall of Residence as one of the best performing Students in Linear Algebra II.
